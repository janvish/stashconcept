Hi this is related to git stash concept 

1st changed in stash
Stash is a temperory shelf or shelves changes you have made to your working directory copy(duplicate)
so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on.
Stashing is handy if you need to quickly switch context and work on something else, but if you're in mid-way
through a code change and arenot quickly ready to commit.
